Bernardo climbed the stairs to the castle’s ramparts. It was a bitterly cold night. He made his way carefully through the freezing fog to relieve Francisco of his guard duty. He saw a dim figure and challenged him.

‘Who’s there?’

‘No, you answer me!’ It was Francisco’s voice. ‘Stop and identify yourself!’

Bernardo stopped. ‘Long live the King!’

‘Bernardo?’

‘Yes, It’s me.’

Francisco relaxed. ‘You’re right on time.’

‘It’s just gone midnight,’ said Bernardo. ‘Get off to bed, Franciso.’

‘Thank God.’ Francisco prepared to leave. ‘It’s freezing and I’m dead bored.’

‘Has it been quiet?’

‘Not even a mouse stirring.’

‘Well goodnight then.’

Bernardo stopped him. ‘If you see the guard master and Horatio, the Prince’s friend, tell them to hurry.’
Francisco set off. He took a few steps then turned and called to Bernardo: ‘I think I can hear them now.’ He went to meet them. ‘Stop! Who’s there?’

‘Friends,’ said Horatio.

‘And loyal subjects of the king,’ said Marcellus.

‘Well goodnight to you, friends,’ said Francisco.
